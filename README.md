# AnotherParticleLife

This project was our first foray into the world of simulations in Unity. In this work we leverage GPU compute shaders to enable the simulation of hundreds of thousands of particles at 30+ FPS.

## Contributing

While we only intended to use this project as a playground for learning game development, and we therefore can't promise prolonged support, we are always open to suggestions for improvement and will try our best to address comments as they come up. To make a suggestion, [open a new issue](https://github.com/ennvita/AnotherParticleLife/issues/new/choose).

If you wish to make your own contributions, feel free to [fork the project](https://github.com/ennvita/AnotherParticleLife/fork) and [open a pull request](https://github.com/ennvita/AnotherParticleLife/compare).

## Getting started

To get started, simply download the project and run [AnotherParticleLife.exe](https://github.com/ennvita/AnotherParticleLife/blob/main/Build/AnotherParticleLife.exe) (on Windows).

If you (wisely) don't feel comfortable running a mysterious executable that you found online, we recommend [downloading Unity](https://unity.com/download) and importing this project as a new Unity project. This is also how you can best modify the code yourself!

Thanks for checking it out!
